# GoodreadsEDA
### By: Trevor Grant

* Note - this project was created the satisfy the requirements for the EDA project
at K2 Data Science bootcamp.

## Goal:

This project is meant to take a list of authors and store all of the review information
made on Goodreads.com about each of that author's books into an sqlite3 database.

The project as it currently stands is interested in exploring two questions:

1. Does a movie / television show made about a work of fiction effect the average
rating of the <em>book</em>?

2. If an effect <em>exists</em> does it carry over to the author's other works?
