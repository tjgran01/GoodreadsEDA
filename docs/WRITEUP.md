# Introduction

It is a common notion amongst the reading populace that film is often unable
to capture some of the main elements that make a work of literary fiction so memorable.
The medium of film, it is argued, as a result of either time constraints, inability
to adequately portray an interior monologue from a first person perspective, or
that film as a whole is a collaborative medium and writing is solitary, often falls
short of the bar that was set by the work from which the film drew it's inspiration.

This concept isn't foreign to those outside of reading circles. It is well known
amongst literary publishers that an upcoming film or television program based off
of a book will translate to a large uptick in sales < citation needed >. People often
wish to read the original version of the story before seeing the film, or television
show, in order to compare the merits or both the original and adaptation. A reader
may also wish to get a deeper version of the story with the book compared to the
version they viewed on screen.

It comes as a surprise when a movie is better received than it's source material
(critically speaking, that is), so much so that this phenomenon requires further
investigation. Do we <em>actually</em> view the book as better than the film? And
if so, then <em>why?</em> or in <em>what way</em> to we view the book as a more valid
version of the story? Though there is a vast theoretical literature explaining why
this phenomenon might be the case, few efforts using publicly avilable data have
corroborated theese claims < citation needed >.

The project aims investigate a small portion of this overarching question. Namely,
does the creation of a film or television show have an significant impact on how
people rate a book? Further, if an effect does exist as a result of an adaptation,
does this have any relation or impact on the author's other works?
